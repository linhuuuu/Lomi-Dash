Narrator: DAY START
Narrator: Lipa City. Heart of Batangas.
Narrator: "One of the most well-known cities coming from the province. Historically known for its Kapeng Barako trade and now its rising urban centers."
Narrator: Your hometown reminds you of childhood traditions in a city that blends modern life with Batangueño values.
Narrator: The air is cool, the streets are calm, and the neon sign of your small lomihan flickers gently in the night.
Narrator: You take a deep breath, feeling the familiar warmth of home.

Protagonist: Ahhhh, ayos! Lipa pa rin talaga, kahit gaano katagal kong hindi bumalik.
Protagonist: Parang kahapon lang talaga ang lahat, nagtitimpla pa ako ng kape kay Tatay tuwing umaga.
Protagonist: Pero ngayon… ako na ang may tindahan, di ko pa din alam kung bakit binigay sa akin ito ni tito.
Protagonist: Ready na akong magserbisyo.
Protagonist: Mainit na lomi, bagong sabaw, at kwentong may halong ngiti—handa na ako.
Protagonist: Sige, laban na. Bukas na ang Lomihan!
Narrator: As the faint chatter of early customers echoes outside, you roll up your sleeves.
Narrator: Another night begins in Lipa—a city that never forgets where its heart truly lies.

Juan: Sus, wag mo akong ginaganiyan, alam kong nagmana ka kay Tito!
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Sad>>
Protagonist: Well speaking of him, nasaan nga po ba si Tito?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Sad>>
Juan: Uhhh.. yeah, about that... Ewan...?
Juan: Besides, yung letter about sa Lomihan, m-

Rival?: Aba...!
Rival: Y o u ..!
Rival: Well, well, well... 'di ko akalain na natakbo pa pala ang lugar na 'to!
Rival: Ikaw, ano ang pangalan mo?

<<setPlayerName SpriteBehaviour>>
Protagonist: {$player}
Rival: Well, {$player}... Ipaalam ko lang sayo ang BAGONG TAYO na lomihan, yours respectively, sa kabilang kanto.
Rival: Safe to say, mananalo na agad ako kapag naglaban.
Rival: They say imagination is your greatest weapon
Rival: And I've done quite a bit of imagining.
Rival: At ayon sa aking pagaaral...
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Rival Angry>>
Rival: Hmph! 
Rival: PAGOD na ang mga tao sa nakagisnan nila. Same old lomi, same old recipes.
Rival: Kailangan na nila ng panibago at kakaibang panlasa.
Rival: Saan ba tayo dinala ng lumang tradisyon? Bakit parang napag-iwanan kana?
Rival: Look at Rome! at Museums! Relics are just proof of what happens when a society fails to adapt.
Juan: Naks... pwede ka na magpulitiko!
Rival: Ugh- you will regret acting smart with me. 
Rival: We travel the same path, the path to Lomi...
Rival: ...But not just any lomi.
Rival: This WAS my ISPESYAL Lomi... MY LOMI.
Rival: Hint: it's all over your kids walls, on their bedsheets, on their pillows, made into marketable little plastic figures.
Rival: Sirit?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Rival Happy>>
Rival: A-ni-me.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Rival Angry>>
Rival: Pangugunahan na kita! Japanese style lomi! Itadakimasu!

Narrator: DAY START
<<setBackground SpriteBehaviour Lipa>>
Narrator: The sun rises over Lipa City—its familiar skyline blending mountains, markets, and the smell of freshly brewed kapeng barako from a nearby stall.
Narrator: The city hums to life once more. And so does your little lomihan.
Narrator: ...

Protagonist: ...
Juan: Right uh... Magbukas ka na nga! Wala tayong magagawa kung madidistract agad tayo.
Protagonist: Hm...
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Sad>>
Juan: Erm... Are you alright?
Protagonist: Do you think... that I should change my bussiness strategy too?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Normal>>
Juan: Well... 'di naman kita mapipigilan kung ‘yon ang gusto mo...
Juan: Pero tanungin na lang kita.
Juan: Sa tingin mo ba, masarap ba ang Lomi mo?

-> I think so.
-> Medyo...
-> I could do better.

<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Happy>>
Juan: Then sapat na ‘yan! Aba, ‘san ka ba makakakuha ng panggatong makagawa lang ng bagong recipe?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Normal>>
Protagonist: May point ka.
Juan: Actually...
Juan: When it comes to ideas, why not ask someone, ‘di ba?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Shock>>
Protagonist: Huh?
Juan: It might not be the big change you’re looking for, pero kung gusto mong ma-inspire, tandaan mo ‘to—
Juan: Lomi brings all sorts of people together.
Juan: Baka sa mga dumarating dito, may isa o dalawa kang makakausap na makakapagbigay sa’yo ng bago.
Juan: ...Kung marunong ka pa makipag-usap, syempre. May natitira pa bang social skills d’yan?
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Normal>>
Protagonist: I think I’m pretty good friends with my plants.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Happy>>
Juan: ...Kaibigan mo pa rin naman ako, so let’s call that progress—bago mo pa ‘ko paiyakin.
Narrator: The two of you share a quiet laugh. Outside, the city noise starts to grow—the day is just beginning.

Juan: Good work today, bro!
Protagonist: Thanks...
Narrator: Looks like word is spreading a bit about your little store. People are starting to remember the old taste they missed—the warmth that once filled this place.
Juan: Well... itutuloy mo pa ba yung changes na iniisip mo kanina?

<<showCharacter SpriteBehaviour Rival at -800 0>>
Rival: (If I just start marketing over here... What if I hire a celebrity—no, what if I hire some artists—)
Protagonist: Hmm...
Rival: (The taste? What do you mean the taste? What does it matter! It’s colorful, it’s unique, and more importantly—we are sponsored by anime!!)
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Angry>>
Juan: Yeah, uh. Magsara na nga tayo.
Narrator: You snort, shaking your head. Some chase fame, others chase flavor—but for tonight, you’ll take the small victories.
Narrator: The neon sign flickers to life again. Lipa hums quietly outside, as if waiting for what tomorrow brings.

<<showCharacter SpriteBehaviour Protagonist at -500 0>>
Protagonist: Hmm? Are you in the good mood?
Juan: I mean... medyo.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Sad>>
Juan: Nakakamiss lang, no? Ngayon na nagkasama na ulit tayo sa lomihan, parang wala parin nagbago sa atin. Tayo paring dalawa ang laging magkasama.
Juan: Nakakatuwa lang na lumaki tayo ng tama.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Happy>>
Juan: Ala... ka aga'y nagiging senti na agad, haha.
Protagonist: I mean, you're correct.
Protagonist: I didn't think I'd even see you again when I moved out. Or that you'd greet me at the airport.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Sad>>
Protagonist: Ano... I'm sorry for not reaching ou-
Juan: Hep! Hep! Mamaya na, ha, no hard feelings.
Juan: Let's have a great day, first, shall we?
Juan: 'Di ga mas masarap ang usapan 'pag gabi na?

Juan: Honestly, nagalala talaga ako nung nalaman ko na mamanahin mo na pala ang lomihan ni tito...
<<showCharacter SpriteBehaviour Protagonist at -500 0>>
Protagonist: Yeah, i was indeed worried too when I heard it for the first time...
Juan: Pero! Mukhang ayos naman ang pagpapatakbo mo!
Juan: Feels like I can rest easy a bit, knowing you got it handed.
Protagonist: Pft...! You sound like my dad...
Juan: Haha, minsan napaparamdam mo rin sa akin iyon. When I first saw you sa airport, matapos ang lahat ng taon na hindi tayo nagkita, doon ko talaga na-realize kung gaano na karami ang nagbago. Pareho na tayong tumanda, ano?
Juan: But just cause you've grown doesn't mean you can't rely on me, You know I got you.
Protagonist: Thanks... I got you too.
Juan: I know you do, I missed you man, really. Bihira na din talaga tayo mag-usap nung nasa states ka, and thought you forgot all about lil ol' me
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Protagonist Sad>>
Protagonist: Listen, what I wanted to say awhile ago... I'm sorry. I should have reached out. I missed you too.
Protagonist: I think I got a bit lost in it all, but I'm glad I got on that flight.
Protagonist: Even seeing you again would have made that flight worth it, so thank you.
Juan: Haha, ang drama mo naman~ Pasalamat ka nalang kay Tita for letting me know na babalik ka na.
<<changeCharacterSprite SpriteBehaviour Juan Happy>>
Juan: Ala eh... Tara na nga, tumagay kana dine. 
Juan: Mahaba pa ang gabi.
Narrator: You recall your apartment, small, expensive, and lonely.
Narrator: You didn't realise you still had a friend in him, or in anyone here. 
Narrator: For the first time in quite a long time- you feel seen.
Narrator: TO BE CONTINUED!
Narrator: ...
Narrator: Hello this is Team Migraine, thank you for taking an interest in Lomi Dash!
Narrator: If you're having fun, please consider taking the time to answer our post-survey questionnaire. 
Narrator: Kulang na kami sa time hhuhuuhuhuhuhu
Narrator: Thanks and God Bless! To more Batangas Locations in the future!
