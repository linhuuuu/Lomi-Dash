  description: "The hometown of the Original Lomii. It\u2019s a bustling city that
    blends modern life with deep-rooted Batangue\xF1o values with community, hospitality,
    and pride in tradition. \n\nI remember that tito was very proud that our hometown
    was called the Heart of Batangas. Honestly. It's a lot to live up to. But this
    is home, a bustling city filled with Batangue\xF1o pride, hospitality and tradition.
    The smell of Kapeng Barako, the neighborhood cafes, the laughter around the old
    cathedrals. How could I forget? It's a bit sappy but tito was right, culture
    lives and breathes with us. I want to try to rediscover it all, my childhood
    memories... the culture my tito taught me and what it is now. \n\nBut for that,
    I need to try and explore what my community has offered me.\n"
