  description: "The Parish of San Sebasti\xE1n de Lipa was found in 1605 by the Augustinians,
    stood as one of Batangas\u2019 earliest centers of faith. After multiple relocations
    caused by the Taal Volcano\u2019s eruptions, the church was rebuilt in its current
    location and completed in 1790. Known for its solid Neo-Classical design and
    artistry, it remains a lasting symbol of Lipa\u2019s devotion, resilience, and
    rich colonial heritage.\n"
