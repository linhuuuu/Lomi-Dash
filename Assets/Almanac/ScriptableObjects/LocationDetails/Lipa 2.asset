  description: "The City of Lipa is known as the Heart of Batangas, where it also
    the origin of the first lomi. It\u2019s a bustling city that blends modern life
    with deep-rooted Batangueno values with community, hospitality, and pride in
    tradition. From the scent of Kapeng Barako filling neighborhood cafes to the
    sound of laughter near its old cathedrals, Lipa reminds players that culture
    thrives not only in history books but in everyday conversations, meals, and moments
    shared. It reconnects with childhood memories and learns about faith, and rediscovering
    the soul of Batangas cuisine through the people who make it meaningful.\n"
