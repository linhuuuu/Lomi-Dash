  description: "The Rice Granary of the Philippines. Like its name, the municipality
    is known for its strong agricultural roots and of course- its vast rice fields.
    I visited the rice fields in Rosario today, it honestly made me very excited
    for Rosario's main event: the Sinukmani Festival. This might very well be my
    first fiesta. I've heard so many good things about the rice cake... I hope I
    can have lots. \n\nThe people here... they're so interesting. I never thought
    I would be able to meet so many interesting people, let alone have them welcome
    me this way. I wanna thank them. But I guess the biggest thank you would be a
    happy stomach right? I'll have the chance to join the festivities when the time
    comes, for now... I want to make people happy.\n"
