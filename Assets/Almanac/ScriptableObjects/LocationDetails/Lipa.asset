  description: "Known as the Heart of Batangas, also the hometown of the Original
    Lomii. It\u2019s a bustling city that blends modern life with deep-rooted Batangue\xF1o
    values with community, hospitality, and pride in tradition. I remember that tito
    was very proud that our hometown was called the heart of Batangas.. Honestly.
    It's a lot to live up to. But this is home, a bustling city filled with batangenueno
    pride, hospitality and tradition. The smell of Kapeng Barako, the neighborhood
    cafes, the laughter around the old cathedrals. How could I forget? It's a bit
    sappy but tito was right, culture lives and breathes with us. I want to try to
    rediscover it all, my childhood memories... the culture my tito taught me and
    what it is now. But for that, I need to live again right? As who I am, not the
    shell of who I was trying to be.\n"
