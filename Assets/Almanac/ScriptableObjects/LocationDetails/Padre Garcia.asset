  description: "Known for their strong agricultural roots and thriving livestock
    trade,  this place clearly showcases the hardworking and close-knit community
    of the Batangue\xF1os. \n\nThe fields... they're so vast. It's so different from
    my cold apartment. Also cows! So many of them... Just there, grazing. I heard
    a lot about the agricultural and livestock trade, but seeing it in person? I
    feel a bit awestruck honestly. Padre Garcia, home of the cows... or something...
    Also I should be used to the hospitality by now, but the community is so close,
    so welcoming... But beyond that? 4am.. 5am... until the sun has completely set,
    the people work, they plan, and they live. There's always something to do, a
    new challenge to face, and no one ever backs down. I feel out of place sometimes,
    I wonder if I'm just a coward... No- I have to try, that's where it begins right?
    I have to try. "
