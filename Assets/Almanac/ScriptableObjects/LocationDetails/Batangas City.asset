  description: "Known as an \"Industrial Port City\", acting not only as the province's
    capital but also as a hub for trade in CALABARZON Region, it is a city that is
    always moving. Day and Night, there's always people moving. From the old captain
    who found home in the waves to the jeepney driver who keeps the city alive, the
    people here truly are tireless. always on the move, always something to transport,
    to bring home. \n\nI visited the port and just watched the people for a bit.
    The ships leaving and entering, thousands of boxes of cargo. It feels like seeing
    a cog in the giant machine of the Philippines. Before airplanes, we are connected
    by the seas after all.\n"
