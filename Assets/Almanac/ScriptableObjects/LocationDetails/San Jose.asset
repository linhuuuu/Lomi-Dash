  description: "The Egg Basket of the Philippines, they weren't kidding about the
    volume of eggs here... especially coming from such a robust Egg and Poultry Industry.
    \n\nIt was my first time trying Salted Eggs, or as they're locally called,  Itlog
    na Pula. Didn't expect it to be this salty... When they told me the other name
    for it I felt betrayed. Besides that, it looks like they export quite a lot,
    from black pepper to citrus. This place is bustling with all sorts of animals
    products and goods.\n"
