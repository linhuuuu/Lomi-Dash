  description: "The Sublian Festival is a two-week celebration that ends every year
    on July 23, honoring the Batangue\xF1os' devotion to their patron saints, the
    Holy Cross in Bauan and Agoncillo, and the Sto. Ni\xF1o in Batangas City. This
    devotion gave rise to the Subli, a traditional dance unique to Batangas. This
    symbolizes devotion and reverence; men perform vigorous steps while women move
    gracefully with fans."
